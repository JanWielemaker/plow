Adds to Petri nets: multiple instances, advanced synchronization
                  patterns, and cancellation patterns.  
1) Multiple active instances of the same activity in the same case.
   I'm not entirely sure that this is needed.
2) synchronizing merge pattern.
   This pattern allows a join on a non-exclusive OR- split.  It may
                  be necessary in this case to re-activate nodes.
                  I'm not 100% sure why this cant be done via a loop
                  and an exclusive or.
3) Cancellation patterns.
   How do you rollback a region?

\mycomment{

The YAWL paper is worthwhile because it clearly delineates how a proposed
model of workflows, which includes some adaptivity, differs from 
high-level (colored) Petri nets.  It also provides a semantics for YAWL.  
This semantics is rather awkward in my opionion, but is at least a 
starting point.         

So this gives a good indication of what state of the art workflow systems
can and can't do, and how we can augment them.

1) lack specific support for patterns involving multiple instances
2) Resynchronization: AND-Join vs XOR join
3) Only local effects of tokens.

\mycomment{ 
This paper basically describes the experience of modelling a protocol
for Breast Cancer follow up in OWL, writing a GEM interface, and then
executing the protocol using the Dalhousie engine.  Some thought does
seem to have been put into the ontology design, although the NCI
ontology is never mentioned, so the two approaches should be compared.

The Dalhousie engine does not look very sophisticated, although there
is a paper on it that needs to be read, nor did this paper address
workflow per se.  However, as of 9/07 it would probably be an
excellent exercise for the AFI group to try to model one of these
guidelines through CDF and our LBL-style engine.

A poor paper, without much content.  The idea, such as it is seems to
                  be that clinical support systems require knowledge
                  from different ontologies and these ontologies may
                  require various merging features.

\mycomment{ The authors propose an architecture for managing medical
guidelines at a patient's home in a personalized and context-dependent
way.  They claim that their proposal relies on "Web Service standards
and Autonomous Agents techniques" (sic).  In their framework, a doctor
sets up one or more general guidelines for a home patient.  At each
step, an activity execution agent may be called, which searches
through its activity library, interfaces with a clinical record
manager a context manager and with web services in order to devise a
next step.  While a step forward from most workflow systems, this is
just a proposal for dealing with context-dependent actions within a
patients workflow.  Their architecture makes obvious use of web
services, and has no real relation to agent architectures.

Their running example has to do with blood thinner management -- if
the patient is mobile, then s/he must go to the lab, otherwise the
patient must take the blood test at home.

Basically a survey article that demands no computer science.  However

                  includes even very basic issues like units of

In addition, it has an excellent bibliography.

\mycomment{
Discusses a mechanism for entity disambiguation for entities found in
documents.  First, for each pair a term harmonic is computed:  

H_{ij} =  (n_{ij}/n_i +   n_{ij}/n_j)/2 

and based on this a normalized term assicoation is computed 

a_{ij} = 1 + (ln(H_{ij}) / ln(1/H_{min}))  : a_{ij} = a_{ji}; a_{ii} =
                  1.
H_min is a scaling constant.  if H_{ij} is below H_min  a_ij will be
                  less than 0, and 0 if H_{ij} = H_min.

Document association -- associations between documents using keywords.

w_i inverse term frequency Ti -- ln(Max-frequency / TermFrequency Ti) 

m_ix is maximum term_association for term i in document x with any term in
                  document y.

Based on these document associations, author associations are
                  determined.  

Author association is the centroid of the Euclidian distance between authors.

Based on this, type-II error probability can be determined either by
                  sampling or by a priori means.

Good general article, including a discussion of the motivation of
                  intuistionistic logic (based on Goldbach's
                  conjecture) and various principles of choice,
                  (e.g. the limited principle of omniscience).
                  Recursive constructive mathematics is covered, as is
                  Bishop's constructive mathematics (which rederives
                  numerous theorems of real analysis within the
                  principles of constructive mathematics).  Finally,
                  there is a discussion of Martin-Lof type theory.

\mycomment{
This is a solid paper that relates various types of Time Petri Nets to
timed Automata.  I spent some time reading through it with the
conclusion that I need to understand Petri Nets more deeply.  It would
also be good to find an overview that gives a taxonomy of the various
timed, stochastic, colored and other forms of Petri Nets.

Not that Petri Nets are difficult to get a basic grip on.  They have a
simple formalism that one can grasp in a few minutes.  But what I
don't understand is how important Petri Nets are for us.  Certainly
Petri Nets are important because other people think they are
important.  But how does their power relate to that of various
automata?  Do Petri Nets give other advantages of an automata-based or
logic based formalism in terms of verifiability?

Anyway, I ordered a book from Amazon on this, so I may have a clearer
understanding soon.

\mycomment{
Shows that, properly expanded, Petri Nets can weakly bisimulate Timed
Automata.  The main differences appear to be in the type of temporal
constraints that are allowed on TPNs vs. those allowed on TAs.

A solid paper, but quite specialized.

Don't know when this appeared.  It gives a semantics for the core UML
metamodel that they call category-theoretic.  However, the category
theory is extremely weak, and is used instead of a general statement
of soundness and completeness.  They then play with it in SLANG.

\mycomment{ 

The paper concerns itself only with Reiter's default logic.  Recall
that a default rule has the form 

     a : b1...bn
     ----------------
           g

which means that if a is provable in a theory and b1,...,bn are
consistent with the theory, then add g to the theory. The b's are
called the justifications of the rule.  A default theory (W,D) is a
set of first order formulas, W, with a set of default rules D.

An extension is a deductive closure of W along with a subset of D
rules.  Of course, an extension can be consistent or inconsistent.

The approach for "open" defaults is to Skolemize the existential
variables, then ground.  Skolemization is necessary in order to derive
a full deductive closure.

doctor(X):richPerson(X)                doctor(Y):\exists Z [childOf(Y,Z)]
--------------------------------                 -----------------------------------------------
  richPerson(X)                                 \exists Z [childOf(Y,Z)]

Let Tom be a doctor.  Then his child childOf(Tom) is also a doctor who
has a child childOf(childOf(Tom)) who is also a doctor.  Of course
this example is not a very likely one in terms of KR.

Skolemization causes certain problems.  First, you can lose the
context of what the Skolem constants represent.

Second problem, consider two A boxes: 

\exists Y [r(a,Y) /\ A(Y) /\ B(Y)]

\exists Y [r(a,Y) /\ A(Y) /\ B(Y)] ; \exists Y [r(a,Y) /\ A(Y)]

Note that these two Aboxes are logically equivalent -- they have the
same models.  Next, consider the rule

A(X) : -B(X)
----------------
    -B(X)

The second Abox gives \exists Y [r(a,Y) /\ B(Y)] but the first does not.  

As far as I can tell, the problem with this is that Skolemization is a
way of building models via constants, and we are mixing theories and
models here in an unexpected way.  Perhaps one way to look at this is
that we are Skolemizing to take the deductive closure in an extension.
However, our theory, W, is not itself deductively closed.  Thus the
anomaly.

They prove undecidability of the DL ALCF extended with default rules
by reducing it to the word problem for semigroups.  They do make use
of functional attributes, but I suspect the proof would go forward
with simple ALC, though perhaps it would be longer.  The rest of the
paper concerns computing extensions.

Recasting some results of ICs into the logic programming framework.
                  Its unclear however, to what extent this gives
                  anything new.  However, ICs do have some depth, and
                  papers like this have started to give rise to

\mycomment{ When reading this paper, I had been hoping for a paper
that clearly indicated how to take a tableau-style algorithm and turn
it into a constraint-style algorithm.  This is important because
tableau algorithms, while clear and efficient, are not always easy to
make incremental.  Typically, one has a formula that one wants to
determine to be true or false, and that's it.  With a constraint
algorithm, on the other hand a subset of constraints may have a
solution, but as new constraints are added the solution may become
refined, or a solution may cease to exist.  Within a workflow, one
might think of application of a workflow rule as changing some of the
temporal constraint store -- some of the old constraints might be
dropped as an action might have happenned, while new constraints may
need to be added.  There are CHR solvers that claim to be complete for
ALC, so I was hoping that this paper might give me some insight into
how this can be done in general.

Unfortunately, in this paper all the authors really do is to use a
constraint solver as part of a tableau style algorithm, to construct a
satisfiability assignment for a given world, and enforce the
constraint relation on the number or r-accessable worlds from a given
world.

\mycomment{

A policy article that argues for the adoption of a data-bank model of
                  EHRs.  It begins by arguing for the benefits of EHRs
                  in terms of reducing costs and improving patient
                  care.  It then discusses present barriers to
                  adoption including asymmetry of costs and benefits
                  of adoption (physicians pay, but patients and labs
                  benefit); lack of national interoperability
                  standards, and fears about privacy.  It then
                  presents its data bank model for EHRs.

This article has relevance to AIF in that it reminds us (as if we
                  could forget :-) of the critical nature of EHRs to
                  workflows and other decision support systems.
                  It would be interesting to see how EHRs have played
                  out in Nova Scotia compared to the US.

\mycomment{ He considers the problems of Hamiltonian path,
K-colorability, and demonstrates that hard problems occur given
particular values of order parameters, where the probability of a
solution is low, but non-neglegable.

Ex. Hamilton path: depends on connectivity.  If connectivity is very
low (say 2) probability of a path is near 0; if high near 1 (a clique
has a hamiltonian path).  Critical connectivity value increases with
N, and sharpens as well.  Hard problems also occur at a distance from
the phase transition (e.g. with connectivity 3).

Ex. K-colorability Depends on different connectivity for different K.
Graphs can be made much larger by applying polynomial-time reductions
to enforce determinism.

Travelling salesman has a phase transition on the number of solutions.

Difficulty of problem depends in part on the type of constraints.

This is because at the phase transition there are various near-minima
and sat-solvers spend a lot of time at these near minima.  Thus
behavior of sat-solvers at phase transition can be affected somewhat
by algorithms (such as dependency-directed backtracking) but not
totally.  }

\mycomment{ Tries to make the case that DM in medicine is unique.
Their perspective is limited, but at tleas the paper is easy to read.
Their points are that it is "unique" becase (taking only the reasonable points)
1) The data is heterogenous
    a) imaging data, textual medical records.
    b) poorly characterized and lacking canonical form.  Here they
                  have a good example
       Colon adenocarcenoma, metastatic to liver
       Colon / Colonic / Large bowel / large intestine / large intestinal  /
                  colon's / of colon

       withliver metastasis / with hepatic metastasis.
2) Ethical legal and privacy issues
    a) who owns the data about a particular patient.
    b) fear of lawsuits
    c) privacy issues  
         anonymous (patient ids never collected)
         anonymized (patient ids collected but then 1-way encripted)
         de-identified (patient ids collected but then 2-way
                            encripted)
         identifeied
3) Statistical issues
     a) "Ambush"  Probably the best way to see this is that an
                  experiment may have to be altered or abandoned before
                  statistically significant results have been
                  achieved.
     b) difficulty in obtaining data for "rare" cases.

A good paper for its time.  It discusses some a paradigm based on
                  passing messages to and from a buffer.  So there
                  are some nice additions possible from the V. 3.0 mt

\mycomment{
The lambda-hat mu mu-hat calculus extends the lambda calculus with
operators that emulate the operational mechanisms of call-by-name
(mu-hat) and call-by-value (mu).  The initial paper by Curien and
Herbelin on lambda-hat mu mu-hat discussed the logic as a sort of
framework.  Wirhin this framework various call-by-value and
call-by-name strategies were defined and proved strogly normalizing,
and other subsyntaxes were also defined and proven strongly
normalizing.  By and large these subsyntaxes were based on
correspondance to proof-theoretic systems, either in the structure of
the calculus itself (lambda mu-hat) or in the structure of its typing
system lambda-hat mu mu-hat_T and lambda-hat mu mu-hat_Q

Summary: Distributed peer-to-peer and grid infrastructure require
                  distributed access control mechanisms. These
                  mechanisms can be implemented in distributed trust
                  management infrastructures and usually require
                  reasoning on more than one peer, as soon as
                  authority is delegated or requests involve several
                  authorities. Building on previous work of the
                  authors which formalized such a distributed trust
                  management infrastructure based on distributed logic
                  programs, we describe in this paper how reasoning
                  can be implemented as distributed logic evaluation
                  and how loops during this evaluation can be handled
                  with. Our solution is based on a loop tolerant
                  distributed tabling algorithm which includes in the
                  process protection of sensitive policies and
                  generation of proofs without increasing the
                  complexity of the system.

\mycomment{
This paper contains a BDI formalism within a CTL framework.  The
interesting variation from the more standard BDI formalisms (ie
Rao/Georgeff) is that a goal is viewed as a tuple (a,b), where a
is the desired state and b is a condition for which to drop the
goal.  In addition, they present a set of planning rules which
relate goals and beliefs to actions.  A set of rules for moving
from agent state to state is presented, and many desirable
properties are proven, mainly the commitment strategies of
Rao/Georgeff.

Middle-agents between requestors and providers

Are capabilities known to requestors?  Are preferences known to
providers?  This gives a space for nine types of agents.  Of these,
the three most important are: 

1) blackboard (preferences known by all, capabilities only known by provider)
2) broker(preferences known by requestor + mid, capabilities known by
                  provider + mid )
3) matchmaker/yellow pages (preferences known only by requestor,
                  capabilities known by all)

Efficiency
Robustness: Brokered systems more centralized and prone to failure.
Adaptivity:

\mycomment{
Presents a good overview of place/transition nets. These generalize
                  elementary (or 1-safe) petri nets in that a place
                  can contain more than one token, and a transition
                  can require several tokens from each input place and
                  deposit several tokens at each output place. Thus,
                  PT nets can model processes such as a buffer of N
                  elements. 

The added power of PT nets makes them harder to reason about in that a
                  finite PT net may not have a finite number of
                  states. However, they present a very interesting
                  theory of \omega sequences with use a form of
                  induction to create abstract classes such that a
                  finite PT net always has a finite number of such
                  classes.

The main contribution of this paper is to derive a type system such
that a lambda-hat mu mu-hat term T is typed if T is strongly
normalizing.  This typing system extends the Curien/Herbelin typing
system by including intersection and union types, and has the nice
properties that one expects from typing systems, including subject
reduction.

\mycomment{Basically provides arguments for why description logics
                  should be more expressive, even at the cost of
                  complexity and completeness.  While the paper starts
                  off with some well-thought-out examples, it tends to
                  degenate into a listing of common arguments.
                  Worst-case is not average case, and even if we can't
                  estimate average case formally, we do have some idea
                  of what we ask.  Furthermore, you have to consider
                  the overall utility of the routines used, etc. etc.

    One of the interesting issues is that since this paper was
                  written, much has been done to study DLs, and this
                  has led not to a diminuition in their use, but to a
                  much better classification of the concepts needed
                  and their interrelations.  People now seem to talk
                  about e.g. ACNQI, rather than the NIKL language
                  etc. 

    Doyle and Patil distinguish between understanding and knowing.  A
                  database knows a lot but understands little -- in
                  the sense that it is able only in a limited sense to
                  derive inferences from that knowledge or to enforce
                  consistency.  A knowledge <\ base supports much
                  richer reasoning -- but can represent much less.

    Strange that this one was accepted, at least at this length.

Does review parts of UML.

Class/Object Diagrams  Used heavily;
Component Diagram Used heavily

Deployment Diagram: Models use of resources.

Use-Case Diagrams are not used by MDAMDL;
StateCharts (modeling object states and transitions);
Activity Diagrams: Procedural Control Flow
Sequence and Collaboration Diagrams

Basically, a rambling paper.  They indicate that models need to be
layered, with a core language and domain-specific extensions.  Also,
models need to be modular.

Defines a semantics for UML activity diagrams and then shows how to

\mycomment{
Much of this thesis concerns org theory and applications of
                  simulation, and is light on content.  He does
                  identify several types of exceptions: 
Activity Temporal Modification
Activity Addition
Activity Deletion
Activity Substitution
Activity Modification

On the content side, it does contain a diagnostic workflow to evaluate
a breast mass, and more importantly a bone-marrow transplant protocol.

\mycomment{
A continuation of the AgentWork? approach by some of the same authors,
                  but its difficult to see how or why AdaptFlow?
                  differs from previous work, or what new work they
                  present. Still, the paper is not bad reading as it
                  indicates some of the "patterns" needed for medical
                  workflows: 

Start, stop, abort, suspend treatment Postpone, substitute, add,
                  delete treatement part delete: drop applications of
                  different drugs Change properties of treatement and
                  treatment part 

Some of these fit into standard WF patterns, but at least some of
                  them, that include time, are new.

\mycomment{ A system description paper of a particular implementation
of MPI called MPI Chamelion, and describing some of the steps that are
needed to make their system both portable and high-performance.

There are a couple of pieces of information to be gleaned from the
paper, however.  First, they allow process groups, then distinguish
between intraprocess communication and interprocess communication.
Communication is handled by communicators that contain attributes of a
communication "channel" and perhaps its state.  Different kinds of
communications can be allowed, including eager communication (send to
a process and let the process worry about buffering); rendezvous
(information is sent only when requested) and get (requestor can mmap
from "sender).  }

Title = "Dynamic Process Management in an MPI Setting"
}

\mycomment{ Discusses an extension to the MPI API to support dynamic
   process management.  It turns out that for a certain amount of
   parallel programming, processes are defined statically, since
   "jobs" have to be scheduled on ACE-NET or other super computers.

Their interface is based in part on communicators, which represent
processes in a cluster in MPI.  They introduce mechanisms to increase
the process size of a communicator, to  spawn more remote processes, etc.

In this type of programming, one process is the "control" and others
are controlled by the first processor, meaning that the ability to
"kill" may be asymmetric.}

Despite the socio-babble boilerplate, they give several examples of
                  unintended consequences from HIT systems, notably
                  CPOE systems (Computerized Point of Entry).
                  Essentially, the new HIT systems break up old,
                  informal methods of communication among staff,
                  leading to less knowledge to support the information
                  decisions.
Worthwhile reading for examples of problems with HIT systems.

They introduce (or use) several changes in terminology.

A feature chain is a set of functional relations.
We also have predicates in a concrete domain.

If u1,...un are feature chains, then 

\exists (u1,...un).P is a 1 ary formula in x  P(u1(x),...,un(x))

\exists (u1,...un)(v1,...,vn).P is a 2 ary formula in 
                   P(u1(x),...,un(x),v1(y),...,v2(y))

Example: 

\exists(serviceArea)(serviceArea).disjoint_area(x,y)

The spatial reasoniing system they use is quite a bit like Allens
Intervals.  A reconstruction of what they have: 

Intersect.
Disjoint = not intersect

Touches => intersect

Inside => intersect

inside => 
Inside-and-touches = Inside and touches
Outside-and-touches = not inside and touches

In a previous paper, the author has developed a model, Open Nets, for
                  composition and decomposition of Petri nets based on category
                  theory (pushouts).  This paper re-explains Open Nets
                  in a set-theoretic manner, and applies them to the
                  problem of workflow composition.  The main problem
                  with the paper is that the results they derive are
                  unsurprising: if you plug output places into input
                  places in the obvious manner, you preserve
                  processes.

The paper cites some potentially interesting work of H. Ehrig
                  et. al. on high-level replacement systems to model
                  net/graph evolution.  Its worthwhile taking a look

\mycomment{The first of these articles gives a reasonably good intro
to the optimizations used by Fact to evaluate its tableaux algorithm.
These optimizations are:

lexical normalization -- making similar formulas "look" the same.
This is done by pushing negation, converting existential to universal,
and sorting subformulas.  smOms just pushes negation.

Semantic branching technique: When a disjunct is chosen, two branches
are started using both A and -A for a given disjunct 

Boolean Constraint Propagation.  Maximizes deterministic expansion.
Deterministicallly expands disjunctions which present only one
expansion possibility.  In other words, expand what it is you may need
to prove.

Dependency directed backtracking.  Backjumping labels formulas with a
dependency set indicating the branching choices upon which they
depend.  When detecting a contradiction, the dependency set is used to
identify the most recent backtracking point that is relevant.

The second paper does little more than allude to iFaCT as a
(relatively unoptimized version) of FaCT to compute ALCFHTI

The third paper extends Fact to compute ALCQHIT -- ALCQH with I and T.
In this paper they have two reasoners: one for SHIQ and one for SHF.
The optimizations mentioned also include simplification (?) and
heuristic guided search, and caching (of partial models)
The third paper also does an analysis of TANCS benchmarks.

The fourth paper simply describes DLP, but comparing it to Fact with
which it seem very similar.

Optimizations of Terminological Reasoning discusses absorbtion, which
essentially is a way of reducing the number of ways to check
consistency.  In particular, it translates clauses of the form A => D
which maybe handled disjunctively, into clauses of the form A -> D
which need be applied only if a primitive concept A is contained
within the tableaux.

\mycomment{The first report introduces transitive roles to ALCI.  In
                  order to do this he uses a tableaux (model
                  generation) algorithm.  The interesting feature of
                  this from a computational viewpoint is that there
                  are two mechanisms for blockages -- directly and
                  indirectly blocked, and different rules may be
                  applied at different times.  So it looks vaguely
                  like a type of restart rule.  How exactly to do this
                  in Smodels isn't quite clear. 

The second report simply modifies the first by making the tableaux
system and blocking somewhat more complicated so that Pspace can be
proven. }

Relates experiences with using OIL for Bioinformatics.  This paper
describes pretty well the cyclic nature of ontology creation --
adding/incorporating a number of classes, then checking consistency

primitive classes of OIL.  Probably good to recommend.

Prodigy [11]).  To call it ontology-driven seems a bit of a misnomer:
they do use ontologies to model aspects of CPGs, but perhaps they use

\mycomment{
     The backdoor set (defined elsewhere) is a set of variables such
                  that, once their truth value is known,
                  satisfiability for the formula as a whole can be
                  done in P time.  Strong backdoor is the analagous
                  concept for unsatisfiability.

     Problems considered here were interesting.  They were "morphed"
                  graph coloring, which constructed graphs starting
                  with 2 ring-lattices, taking all the edges common
                  to the two graphs, and randomly taking edges from
                  the differences.  This leads to families of graphs
                  with varying structure.  In addition, they
                  considered quasi-groups (latin squares).  These
                  quasi-groups were generated from solved
                  quasi-groups via removing entries.

      Backdoor sets do not take into account dependencies among
                  variables within the set.  In other words, certain
                  of the set variables may be dependent on one
                  another, but this may not be determined in P-time,
                  or by a given solver.  Backdoor key fraction is
                  backdoor dep variables over indep variabls.  It can
                  be shown backdoor key fractions correlate with
                  instance and problem hardness.

\mycomment{
I just read the paper and, while I think it has relevence to our
project, it seems to be at a high enough level that
                 there is relatively little that we can take from
                  it at a concrete level.  Like us, they are imagining a dynamic workflow
                  for healthcare, particularly chronic conditions.
                  They do look like they've thought a little more
                  than us about the workflow aspects, including
                  sub-flows, but also a bit less than us about the
                  ontological aspects or verification.  

There is a concrete example on pg. 497.  I'll talk to Barry to see how
                  easy it is to model this example in his simulator.

In this paper they discuss the language Carin, which includes 1) ALCNR
and 2) recursive horn rules, for defining relationships.

It may be decidable if you can restrict to finite models, and may well
make a good extension of the stable models translation.  It is
probably worthwhile taking a second look at this paper.

\mycomment{ In their terminology a classifier is a "reasoner" that
computes subsumption relationships between definitions and tests
theinternal consistency of definitions and constraints.  A recognizer
(or realizer) computes instantiation relationships between instances
and concepts.  They find that Loom uses recognition much more than
classification.

They describe a separate algorithm for recognition and classification,
along with a backward-chaining classifier.  The classical
classification algorithms apparently used an A/C strategy of first
abstracting and then classifying.  Abstraction means coming up with a
description that the assertions satisfy, and then trying to classify
the new descriptions via the standard subsumption relation -- a
somewhat forward-chaining approach.

Tbox concept component; Abox individual component.

For them, a description is a lambda expression with one varable.
Below are atomic descriptions or features.

all(R,C) equates to our schrel
atLeast(1,R) and all(R,C) equates to our irel
constraints can do more general atLeast and atMost
filledBy(R,I)
sameAs(R1,R2) = \lambda x.\forall y.  R1(x,y) iff R2(x,y)

So, one of the problems with classical classifiers is that since
individuals are pairwise distinct, their descriptions will also be
pairwise distinct -- at a given level of detail, leading quickly to an
unmanageable system.

In addition, every update to an instance must update its relation to
every description that it satisfies.

In the LOOM algorithm, they construct a "specialized subsumption test"
that allows it to compare an instance against a description avoiding
generation of an abstract description.

Their "twist" is to navigate through the set of concepts and see if an
instance satisfies each of these concepts.  At each point, they cache
the features that the instance satisfies.

An interesting paper that analyzes some of the major guideline formats
                  (GLIF, GEM, etc) in terms of workflow control
                  patterns.  It turns out that the 43 workflow control
                  patterns are sufficient to cover most of the
                  situations needed by guidelines. Two new
                  patterns, "deferred multi-choice" and "forced
                  trigger" are not covered in the canonical 43 patterns.

While control patterns are only one aspect of guidlines: there are also
                  data and resource patterns.  Additionally, guideline
                  managment also includes temporal
                  reasoning, constraint-based reasoning for resources
                  and perhaps probabilistic or fuzzy
                  reasoning) it is nice to know that the work we've
                  begun to do on workflow simulation in XSB already covers
                  most of the patterns needed by these guideline
                  systems.  This is good news, although workflows for
                  patient management may require other types of
                  control not specifically required by guideline languages

\mycomment{

In the dynamic object model, they appear to be talking about a
different way to use, e.g. Java classes.  So I suppose it implicitly
points out a difference between OO programming and Ontologies --
ontologies by their nature are dynamic and check consistency.
Essentially, they advocate an extra level of indirection between
objects and their properties.

In their usage, hasAttr, allAttr, etc is metadata.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Revision Programs 

\mycomment{ 
Revision programs are basically a reinterpretation of logic
programming in terms of database change, but with some interesting
twists.  Syntactically, a negative literal is specified by out(a), and
a positive literal by in(a), and sets of such literals are a database.
Semantics are defined in terms of a P-justified revision of a database
D1 into a database D2.  To define this some concepts are needed.  (1)
the intertia between D1 and D2 I(D1,D2) is defined as in atoms that
are in D1 and D2 along with out atoms that are in neither D1 nor D2.
(2) The reduct of P, P_{D1,D2} is defined by removing from rules of P
all body literals in I(D1,D2).  (3) Let S1 be a set of in and out
literals.  D1 \bigosum S is defined as D1 unioned with all in-literals
in S1 and with all out-literals in S1 removed.  Finally, D2 is a
P-justified revision of D1 if D2 = D1 \bigosum lfp(P_{D1,D2}).

This is the simplest formalism, it can be extended to involve
disjunctive heads in a non-surprising manner, and also to involve
annotations.

So, if we think of revision programs as a set P of rules, at each
state S in a workflow we'd find a state S' such that S' is a
P-justified revision of S.  S' may not be unique, but it isn't in the
Lewis-Bernstein formalism, either.  

This is a powerful formalism, with the cost that finding a P justified
revision is NP-Complete.  However, in practice it may be that it is a
useful way of enforcing constraints as we go from one workflow state
to another (i.e. an agents desires is a module of a logic program).  

It seems a critical next step is to understand in detail how this
approach relates to the Lewis-Bernstein approach.

\mycomment{ Lays out the basis of revision programs with a lot of
theorems about properties of revision programs, in order to justify
their notion of update.  This is the best paper to start with.
However, to my current understanding, many of the results about the
relation of revision programs to stable models, the sequentiality of
updates, and safe updates (stratified programs) are relatively
unimportant as they can be derived from stable model theory plus the
shifting theorem (I think).}

The authors extend Revision programs to include annotations -- where
                  the annotations are complete infinitely distributive
                  lattices with the demorgan property.  Using these
                  lattices, things go through ok: the justified
                  revision of a program is modelled as 
                  (Old join -New) meet New 
Where the join to -New is needed to take into account negative
information from New.  Using this definition things
                  go pretty well overall -- however the reduction that
                  they use to obtain the revision program is a little
                  different than a naive generalization of a SM
                  reduction.  In their reduction, a pseudo complement
                  must be taken with respect to the initial model.
                  The pseudo-complement restricts the number of
                  revisions, as it may leave literals in the bodies of
                  rules rather than removing them.  As a result, there
                  are fewer revisions if the pseudo-complement is
                  used, and this avoids anomalies in a revision not
                  being a model of a program, and in program rewriting

Applies preferences to revision programs.  Rule-based preferences are
                  used for hard preferences, and weights for soft
                  preferences.  In general, it is a
  straightforward application, as the theory of preferences for
                  stable models are well-developed, and revision
                  programs can easily be translted to stable model

Entity Matching is a nearly ubiquitous problem with solutions that are
                  usually speficic to the domain and corpus being
                  matched. In this paper, the authors formalize the
                  problem as the need to match 2 or more records, each
                  associated with a given confidence interval to
                  create a new record associate with a new (usually
                  lower) confidence interval. 

They formulate various approaches to the problem, including a naive
                  fixed point, a semi-naive fixed point (Koosh) and
                  other mechanisms for deleting redundent records --
                  those for which other, more informative records
                  exist with confidence at least as good.

Written in Prolog and C++.  Gives constraint-generated critiques of
                  various aspects of protocol authoring.  

Example: in ethics, if a user chooses theophyline as a control drug,
                  a criticism may be made that there are other asthma
                  drugs with fewer side-effects.  In developing their
                  system, they have systematically moved constraint
                  handling earlier and earlier in the process (to
                  avoid ramifications).

   C++ routines to generate sample sizes based on various
                  medical criteria.  

   Uses, in some sense, an ontology based on GLIF.  E.g. safety
                  checks, outcome measures, entity criteria, etc are
                  related to a given data element.

   Basically they have a NL hypertext interface to their system.
                  Their reporting of constraints is layered, in the
                  sense that, for example, one could find full
                  side-effects by drilling down.  Similarly, their
                  system would indicate that side effects to a
                  particular drug were unknown.

\mycomment{

They take an input program P and use lparse to produce a
grounding and partial evaluation (GP) of P, along with a
possibilistic grounded program GPP.  They use GP to produce
stable models using smodels and for each model M of GP they
reduce GPP by M and construct the possibilistic fixed point of
GPP/M applying mins to the ands and maxes to the ors.

In principle this should add a factor that is constant in the
size of the program to each stable model that is constructed.
They rely on the possibility factors associated with each rule to
be ground for the input program, and perform a second pass on the
logic program.  Due to these two steps, they avoid the problems
that I encountered with translating shortest path directly into
an ASP program.

So the question arises of why they are so slow on the path
examples.  I think that one reason for this is that the bottom up
approach does not have the same relevancy as our top-down
approach: accordingly they end up computing the paths for all
pairs.  This would move them from linear in the number of
nodes (as we are) to quadratic to find the paths between all
pairs.  They must actually do this twice -- once in smodels and
once in their own code.

I did look again at the posSmodels paper to understand better how
they do negation.  Their approach depends on a semantics for
possibilistic logic that I think is a little dubious.  For a
possibilistic program, they first take the underlying normal
program and send it to Smodels to find a stable model.  They then
form the reduct with respect to the stable model.  Finally they
re-annotate the reduct with the possibility measures and compute
the possibilities of the least fixed point.  The reason that this
seems dubious is that if you had the program

p:- not r
q:- not s.

(s, 0.0001)
(r, 1)

then p and q would both be false (truth value 0) in the unique stable
model.

An excellent summary of recent work in adding time to Petri Nets and
                  automata. Various flavors of both are described, and
                  compared. Extensions of time to CTL and LTL are
                  given, and various abstract models are shown so that
                  the states traversed in explicit verification are
                  finite (and hopefully not too large). Other methods
                  for explicit verification and for sat-based
                  verification are presented.

A simple form of game theory can be cast as a set of P players, a set
O of outcomes, and a binary relation $>_C$ on O for every coalition
(subset of P).  A cooperative game has a utility function v() which
assigns utilities to each plaryer for each outcome.  Then, informally,
a cooperative game is one in which the players form different
coalitions and force different outcomes depending on the utilities of
each member of the coalition.  

Thus, a cooperative game is a matter of gorming coalitions in response
to changes in outcomes and utility functions.  This paper models
cooperative games as logic programs and uses Revision programs to find
minimal changes in coalitions.

which discusses transformation techniques for removing existential and
other variables from the bodies of clauses.  It turns out that the
techniques discussed are potentially useful in certain cases, but
limited.  As a result, we still need constructive negation for abdual,
but there may be transformation techniques that allow us to avoid
the expensive use of constructive negation in certain cases. 

In that paper, they also discuss removing unnecessary variables when
predicates are functional on certain arguments.  Its obvious once you
think about it, but functionality may also allow us to avoid expensive
techniques for existential variables.

\mycomment{

An introduction to "vanilla" Petri Nets i.e. those that do not
have colors (types), or time.  The material is presented
formally, but with plenty of examples so that it should be
accessable to those with varying mathematical experience.  A bit
of a disadvantage is that the article is long, although it is
fairly quickly readable.
v
While I'm not done with the article, it has already answered a
question of mine -- the relation between Petri Nets and FSMs.  It
turns out that by labelling the edges of a Petri Net, and constructing
a {\em Sequential Configuration Graph} (essentially configurations of
a Petri Net), prefix-closed regular languages can be recognized.
However, not all regular languages are recognized in this
construction, nor are all prefix-closed regular languages.

So it turns out that FSMs can do some things that Petri Nets can't do
(at least via the SCG construction).  So far, I haven't seen a formal
embedding of FSMs into Petri Nets.  Petri Nets have transitions that
fire on configurations of a graph, which can include tokens in more
than one state-vertex, so that such a construction seems possible.

Discusses a "Protocol Critiquing Tool" PICASSO that critiques on 2 levels:
                  structure and methodology.  Methodology includes
                  analysis of sample size, endpoints, choice of
                  arms.  Structure includes patient treatments,
                  monitoring tests, drug toxicity.  Their KB focuses
                  on structure, rather than methodology.

    They use an ontology to derive constraints -- 3 types: do not
                  prescribe contra-indicated drugs, do not prescribe
                  interacting drugs, and perform all monitoring
                  services.

Presents 43 different control-flow patterns that they claim are

PRMs: Consider a schema $S$ with classes, attributes, and relations.
A PRM adds to the schema a set of parents parents(X,A) for each class
and descriptive attribute.  In addition, it requires a conditional
probability distribution Prob(X.A | parents(X,A)) that is consistent
(under some conditions) with the manifestation in the database.

This PRM model assumes {\em structural certainty}.  Two ways to loosen
structural certainty.

Reference Uncertainty. (hasAttr uncertainty) In this case, we'd like
to be able to predict the value of attributes to which a class
belongs.

A somewhat theoretical paper, that tries to use prior and posterior
                  probability values within assessments.  The idea is
                  to be able to use various kinds of information
                  (e.g. population statistics) to update
                  probabilities for assessment.  The problems they are
                  trying to solve is to reduce the time/number of
                  questions in an assessment, to better elucidate
                  utility functions, etc.}

\mycomment{
From its title, this looks like a paper of interest -- with relevance
to CRMS and our various plans to include ontologies in our work.
Their problem is a bit different than CRMS, however as their interest
is in being able to share and understand the data from various
clinical trials that have to do with Immune Tolerence of
translaplants.  In fact, this sharing and understanding is linked with
a laboratory workflow system of Cimarron, somehow.  While the paper
does have some interest for its explicit description of how ontologies
are actually used to structure information, it is presented at such a
general level that it is difficult to understand exactly what the
ontologies are doing.  

Probably not a manuscrupt, but I don't know the proceedings.

\mycomment{

XML markup proposal to represent clinical guidelines, as opposed
to clinical pathways or research protocols.  Part of the markup
is analogous to the Dublin Core: identity, developer, purpose,
etc.  However it also has a section called "Knoweledge
components" that contain recommendations, definitions, and
algorithms.  

Recommendations may be conditional or imperative, where
conditional means checking a simple variable decision
relationship and then triggering an "action".  Algorithmically
this is crude, but they also include meta information about the
recommendations such as the evidence quality, the strength, or
flexibility.  Quantitative tests, specificity, predictive value,
etc for individual decision variables are also described.

A slot for definitions is also provided, and these definitions
may implicitly have rules for classification: e.g. a definition
of "high-risk mothers" in a CDC guideline for Hepatitis B.

Finally, they also have a slot for algorithms, mostly to support
GLIF flowcharts, which can be broken down into guieline
steps (action steps, conditional steps, branch steps, and
synchronization steps).

Discusses various high-level nets from color nets to predicate
                  nets. Its a rather formal approach, however, as he
                  defines many of these in terms of equivalence
                  classes -- an approach that makes perfect sense for
                  color nets, but seems less useful for higher level

@manual{UPPAAL2k,
KEY = {UPAAL},
Title = {UPAAL2k: Small Tutorial},
Year = 2002}

\mycomment{ 
UPPAAL contains an editor, a simulator, and a verifier.  In their
version of timed automata, transitions have guards and
synchronizations.  When taking a transition, variables may be assigned
or clocks reset.

Within the editor {\em templates} (essentially a procedure call) allow
creation of sub-automata that vary only with respect to certain
variables or constants.  Thus within the TMZ protocol, a template
could be used to handle the N different actions within a cycle.

Verification uses CTL-like formulas.  E<>P.end indicates, for instance
that P.end is reachable (i.e. state end in process P), while A[]F
indicates that under any path F is true.  Properties may also be saved
into libraries so that they may be rechecked as the process changes.

They give an example of using UPPAAL on a mutual exclusion algorithm
(which does not need timed automata).  They also give an example of
time handling in UPPAAL.  Time is handled via a data type called a
"clock" -- since clocks are a data type, several can be declared, and
variables of type clock can be compared and assigned values.  A given
clock synchronizes a process via a {channel}.  A messache is sent out
on a channel c via the expression c! and is recieved via the
expression c?  Clock variables can be used within verification
properties.

In order to execute a synchronization step, both a lower bound and an
upper bound may be given.  Because their model of time is continuous,
they do not assume that a synchronization happens at a given point,
but only within a given interval.  Thus, in principle, both a lower
and an upper bound must be present to fully indicate the interval for
a synchronization.  It turns out that they do not implement such
transitions quite right, and so they offer urgent and committed
transitions.  An urgent channel is taken as soon as it is enabled --
i.e. as soon as the guard is true.  Apart from this, the semantics of
urgent and committed channels and states is a bit murky to me.

Keith:

Urgent Channels: Time is not permitted to advance in the source
                  location. Some edge in the network, but not
                  neccessarily in the automata with the urgent
                  channel, must fire. For a committed channel, the
                  automata with the committed channel must be
                  involved. The edge with the urgent/committed channel
                  does not, however, need to be the edge(s) fired if
                  there are other enabled edges from the source
                  location. It is possible to declare the priority of
                  channels. 

Urgent Locations: Time is not permitted to advance in an urgent(or
                  committed) location. It is equivalent to adding a
                  new clock that is reset whenever entering the
                  location and adding an invariant that the new clock
                  <= 0. Other automata in the network are allowed to
                  fire enabled transitions as long as time does not
                  advance. Committed locations are more restrictive in
                  that the next transition must involve the automata
                  with the committed location. I've added an example
                  to illustrate this [here]. You can step through the
                  simulation to see that it allows the first process
                  to continue processing. Change the urgent location
                  to committed and rerun the simulation. The result is
                  deadlock.

\mycomment{
Although the paper starts off with a vague description of
                  sociotechnical analysis, the authors quickly turn to
                  a detailed set of studies of a PDA-based CPOE
                  system.  Usability studies are a part of the
                  measurement, but they also had a time-series
                  measurement of error rates.  A prior and posterio social network
                  analysis was used to understand how patterns of
                  communications change.  They also consider work
                  measurement studies (how much time doctors spend
                  doing what, nurses spend doing what etc.) to
                  understand when time savings may be gained from a
                  CPOE features, and when time savings may be
                  negligible (e.g. time searching for a missing
                  medical record).

Clearly such studies should be part of AIF deployment, and this
                  article should be read by AIF people who are working
                  on the requirements analysis portion of paliative
                  care -- its probably not too early to start thinking
                  about deployment and metrics for success.

\mycomment{
This is a solid paper that relates various types of Time Petri Nets to
timed Automata.  I spent some time reading through it with the
conclusion that I need to understand Petri Nets more deeply.  It would
also be good to find an overview that gives a taxonomy of the various
timed, stochastic, colored and other forms of Petri Nets.

Not that Petri Nets are difficult to get a basic grip on.  They have a
simple formalism that one can grasp in a few minutes.  But what I
don't understand is how important Petri Nets are for us.  Certainly
Petri Nets are important because other people think they are
important.  But how does their power relate to that of various
automata?  Do Petri Nets give other advantages of an automata-based or
logic based formalism in terms of verifiability?

Anyway, I ordered a book from Amazon on this, so I may have a clearer
understanding soon.
